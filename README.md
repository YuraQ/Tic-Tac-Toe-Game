#Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project is one of my initial ventures into JavaScript programming. As I was learning JavaScript, I decided to create a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. It provided me with an opportunity to apply my newfound knowledge and gain practical experience.

##Features
The game allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid.
The players can enter their names at the beginning of the game.
The game board is displayed using HTML table elements (<td>) on a web page.
Each player's move is represented by X or O and can be placed by clicking on the grid.
The computer's move is randomly generated using JavaScript.
The game checks for a winning combination or a draw after each move.
A winner is declared, and the game board is cleared for a new game.
The score is tracked, and the number of wins for each player is displayed.
  
##Technologies Used
HTML: Used to structure the game board and elements on the web page.
CSS: Used for basic styling and layout of the game board.
JavaScript: Used to handle player moves, generate computer moves, and determine game outcomes.
  
##About the Project
This project holds a special place for me as it represents one of my initial projects created while learning JavaScript. It served as a practical exercise to apply the concepts and principles I learned during my JavaScript learning journey.

By building the Tic-Tac-Toe game, I aimed to reinforce my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals such as variables, functions, event handling, and DOM manipulation. It also helped me grasp the concept of game logic and conditional statements.

Although the project may seem simple, it played a crucial role in solidifying my JavaScript skills and provided a foundation for more complex projects in the future. I'm proud of this project as it showcases my early progress and enthusiasm for learning JavaScript.
